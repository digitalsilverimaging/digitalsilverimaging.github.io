## Automatic Banding Adjustment (Paper Feed Adjustment)

From <https://support.usa.canon.com/library/ij/Manual/All/PRO-4000/EN/UG/ug_paperfeed01_0102.html>:

If printed images are affected by banding in different colors across the sheet, execute **Adjust print quality** for automatic adjustment of the paper feed amount. The printer prints and reads a test pattern for automatic adjustment of the feed amount.


!!! Tip
    Always check the Set priority values.

### Selecting Feed Amount Adjustment Method

There are two methods of adjusting the paper feed amount, Prioritize print quality and Prioritize length accuracy, either of which will be applied during printing.

Follow the procedure below to perform settings.

1. Load paper.
2. Tap HOME screen then tap Maintenance.
3. Tap Paper feed adjustment.
4. Tap Set priority.
5. Tap paper to adjust.
6. Tap setting "Prioritize print quality"
7. Tap OK on displayed screen.


Follow the procedure below to adjust.

1. Load paper

A test pattern is printed for adjustment and adjustment is finished.
