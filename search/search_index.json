Click Next Evaluate cone The cone is the white area which shows the tollerance of deltaE values of the patches The ideal cone should be wide on the left with most lines inside. There is room for flexibility with the cone and judgment is required. If the cone is acceptable click Cancel and exit Fusion 3 Warning Do not click Next because Fusion will try to iterate the grey balance and you risk making a worse calibration If you read in a calibration strip that is too light (lines lower than cone) it means that the developer is too weak and needs to be replenished. If too dark (lines higher than cone) means that the developer density is too high and needs to be deluted.
